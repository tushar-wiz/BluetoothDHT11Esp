# ESP32 Code
Need to be built and flashed to a ESP32 using the ESP-idf

## WORK STILL IN PROGRESS
It Works but is not the best implementation as it only uses one Characteristic to send both Temperature and Humidity. Also It relies on READ event from client i.e. Notification are not setup

### NOTE
Replace <Your Own 128bit UUID> before using
